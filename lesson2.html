    <b>what are basic HTML tags</b>-
    Basic HTML tags is a collection of html elements used to define the architecture of a web page.
    <p>
    <h4>Explanation of headings H1 to H6</h4>
    The H1 to H6 HTML elements represent six levels of section headings. H1 is the highest section level and H6 is the lowest. By default, all heading elements create a block-level box in the layout, starting on a new line and taking up the full width available in their containing block.
    <h4>Explanation of a paragraph tag </h4>
    The HTML paragraph tag is a fundamental element used for creating paragraphs in web development. It helps structure content, separating text into distinct blocks.
    <h4>Diffrences between the header tags and a paragraph tag</h4>
